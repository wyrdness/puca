      "summary": "Irish shapeshifting fairy creature, most commonly appearing as a black horse, known for taking humans on wild rides and acting as a trickster with ambiguous morality.",
      "full": "The Púca is a shapeshifting creature from Irish folklore, considered one of the most feared and respected of the fairy folk. While it can take many forms - including goat, rabbit, dog, goblin, or human - it most commonly appears as a sleek black horse with glowing eyes. The Púca is known for offering rides to unsuspecting travelers, then taking them on a wild, terrifying gallop before throwing them into mud or water (usually harmlessly). Despite its trickster nature, the Púca can be helpful to those who treat it with respect, and it holds special significance in harvest traditions. After November 1 (Samhain), any crops left in the field are considered to belong to the Púca. The creature can speak human language in any form and possesses an ambiguous morality - neither fully good nor evil, but demanding respect and proper behavior from humans."
